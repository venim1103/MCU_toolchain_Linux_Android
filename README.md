#Public repository for MCU development

This repository is a simple (=crude) implementation of ready made tools by other people. 
The idea was to make some simple scripts to install and use different MCU building and flashing tools 
inside a Linux Ubuntu environment (mainly for running the compilation environment inside an Android device using the Linux Deploy app for OS installation.)
